### MedBud respects your privacy. This privacy policy outlines how your information is handled by our app.

**Data Collection**  
- We do not collect or share any personal data from users.  
- The app does not require you to create an account or enter any personally identifiable information.  
- All data you enter, such as medication names and times, is stored locally on your device using Core Data.  
- We do not use any analytics tools or third-party services to track your behavior.

**Notifications**  
MedBud utilizes local notifications to remind you to take your medications at the scheduled times. These notifications are managed and triggered entirely on your device. We do not have access to or collect your notification data.

**Data Security**  
Since all your data stays on your device, it is protected by your device’s built-in security features. We recommend keeping your device’s software up to date and enabling a device passcode for added protection.

**Changes to This Policy**  
If we ever change the way the app handles data, we will update this privacy policy and notify users accordingly.
